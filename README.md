# Heart-Disease-Predictor

DATASET USED : 
UCI Heart Disease Data

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data

Prediction Heart disease based on the following data :

age (Age of the patient in years)
origin (place of study)
sex (Male/Female)
cp chest pain type ([typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal, asymptomatic])
trestbps resting blood pressure (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)
fbs (if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
-- Values: [normal, stt abnormality, lv hypertrophy]
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise-induced angina (True/ False)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: [normal; fixed defect; reversible defect]
target: the predicted attribut
